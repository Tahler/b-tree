- Added specific helper methods for reading and writing integers in the base File class.
- byte arrays have to be int arrays in Java because of the lack of unsigned bytes. Only one byte is written per int to
  file still, however.
- Had a small error in MetaDataFile::read, easily seen and fixed
- Left out a small detail in PersistentArray::create, easily seen and fixed
- In the design, the PersistentArray would take some metadata space of the MetadataFile that it uses. This requires some
  array copying and annoyingly writing an int into a byte[]. I will instead let the PersistentArray chunk more of the
  file and set another offset, similar to how MetadataFile has an offset for reading and writing data.
