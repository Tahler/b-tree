- Added specific helper methods for reading and writing integers in the base File class.
- byte arrays have to be int arrays in Java because of the lack of unsigned bytes. Only one byte is written per int to
  file still, however.
- Had a small error in MetaDataFile::read, easily seen and fixed
- Left out a small detail in PersistentArray::create, easily seen and fixed
